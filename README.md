# WBiCM

This repository hosts the weighted version of BiCM [1], developed using CReMa as a foundation [2]. 
An in-depth discussion of the model can be found in the supplementary information of [3].


The 'WBiCM' file contains the class where the model is implemented. The 'example' file provides a sample application of the model, demonstrating the problem-solving process by identifying the Lagrange multipliers and generating the ensemble.
